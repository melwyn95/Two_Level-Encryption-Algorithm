This is a two-level encrytion algorithm.
Enter Text To be Encrypted: Hey There! Good Morning .....
User Input is divided in blocks of 9 charactes.
Public and Private keys of Alice and Bob are randomly chosen.
The keys chosen are minimum 9 digit prime numbers.
Keys are exchanged between Alice and Bob using Diffie-Hellman Algorithm.
A common symmetric key is calculated by echanging the public and private keys.
Plain Text Block at Alice's side: ['H', 'e', 'y', ' ', 'T', 'h', 'e', 'r', 'e']
The plain text block is Encryted using two-level algoirithm......
